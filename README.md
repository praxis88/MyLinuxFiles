This is a personal github.

I use it to store my dotfiles, which reside in the home folder or the $HOME/.config/ folders. 

I have included various font files, which are to be installed under /usr/share/fonts/.

The asound.state file is a file for enabling the sound on my Edgar Chromebook. 

I have also included routerconfig.tcl which is a file that just lists various commands and configurations for working with Cisco Routers. 

The purpose of this github is to allow for synchronization of configuration between my own personal computers, and to allow quick restoration in the event of a reinstall.
